# About Me
I'm a born and raised Brooklyn native who comes from a Jamaican father and an American mother born in the Y2K era.
I'm a full-time student at York College of the City University of New York (CUNY) with a major in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics.

Outside of class, I'm a Data Science Fellow in CUNY Tech Prep, I serve as a Student Ambassador for the New York Jobs CEO Council, and I'm a Student at CodePath as well.

Outside of academia, I work part time as a ramp agent at JFK for JetBlue.

My goals as of right now are to land an internship and do well to secure a full-time role, become a CS or DS grad student, and to continue to be mentally, physically and spiritually aligned. (Mind, Body, and Soul) 

**Fun Facts** I'm one of the many tall people that don't play basketball, I lenjoy looking at life through a history and philosophy, and all around I'm a pretty chill guy
